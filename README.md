# Resources and VSCode Setup
To setup the VSCode LeetCode extension I used this article: https://betterprogramming.pub/work-on-leetcode-problems-in-vs-code-5fedf1a06ca1

For the file path I used the following in settings.json:
```json
"leetcode.filePath": {
    "default": {
      "folder": "problems/${id}/${ext}",
      "filename": "${id}.${kebab-case-name}.${ext}"
    }
  },
```
